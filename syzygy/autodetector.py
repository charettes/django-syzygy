    Migration auto-detector that splits migrations containing sequence of
    operations incompatible with staged deployments.

    It works by inserting fake `Stage` operations into a fake __stage__
    application since `_build_migration_list` will only split operations of a
    single application into multiple migrations if it has external
    dependencies.

    By creating a chain of external application dependencies between operations::

        app.FirstOperation -> __stage__.Stage -> app.SecondOperation

    The auto-detector will generate a sequence of migrations of the form::

        app.Migration1(operations=[FirstOperation])
        __stage__.Migration1(operations=[Stage])
        app.Migration2(operations=[FirstOperation])

    And automatically remove the __stage__ migrations since it's a not
    an existing application.
